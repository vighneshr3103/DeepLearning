1. TensorFlow Basics

Introduction to TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning platform that enables building, training, and deploying models in various environments, from research to production. It provides a flexible, scalable framework that supports a wide range of machine learning tasks, from simple linear models to deep learning neural networks.

Installing TensorFlow

pip install tensorflow

Basic TensorFlow Operations

import tensorflow as tf

# Create a constant tensor
hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
print(hello.numpy())

# Basic mathematical operation
a = tf.constant(10)
b = tf.constant(32)
c = tf.add(a, b)
print(f"a + b = {c.numpy()}")

2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in TensorFlow

Understanding CNNs

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are primarily used for analyzing visual data. They are designed to process grid-like data structures, such as images, and are particularly effective in tasks like image classification and object detection. CNNs utilize convolutional layers to extract spatial features and patterns from the data.

Building a CNN with TensorFlow

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import datasets, layers, models

# Load and prepare the CIFAR-10 dataset
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = datasets.cifar10.load_data()
train_images, test_images = train_images / 255.0, test_images / 255.0  # Normalize pixel values

# Build the CNN model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10)
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))

3. TensorFlow Perceptron

Single-layer Perceptron in TensorFlow

A perceptron is the simplest form of an artificial neural network. It consists of a single layer with an activation function.

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
import numpy as np

# Sample data (OR function)
X = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]], dtype='float32')
y = np.array([[0], [1], [1], [1]], dtype='float32')

# Build the perceptron model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(1, input_dim=2, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)

# Predict on new data
print(model.predict(X))


---

4. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in TensorFlow

Building an ANN for Classification

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) can consist of multiple layers, including an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. Here, we’ll build a simple ANN to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import datasets, layers, models

# Load and prepare the MNIST dataset
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = datasets.mnist.load_data()
train_images, test_images = train_images / 255.0, test_images / 255.0  # Normalize pixel values

# Build the ANN model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))


---

5. CNN in TensorFlow (Advanced)

Advanced CNN Architectures (ResNet Example)

ResNet is a deep CNN architecture known for using residual blocks to combat vanishing gradient issues in very deep networks.

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50

# Load a pre-trained ResNet model
resnet_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')

# Print model summary
resnet_model.summary()


---

6. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in TensorFlow

Building an RNN for Time Series Forecasting

RNNs are useful for tasks involving sequential data, such as time series prediction and natural language processing.

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic sequential data
X = np.random.rand(100, 10, 1)  # 100 sequences, each of length 10
y = np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Build the RNN model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.SimpleRNN(50, input_shape=(10, 1)),
    layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)

7. Style Transfer in TensorFlow

Building a Style Transfer Model

Neural style transfer uses deep learning to combine the content of one image with the style of another. TensorFlow Hub provides pre-trained models for this task.

import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

# Load pre-trained neural style transfer model
hub_model = hub.KerasLayer('https://tfhub.dev/google/magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256/2')

# Load content and style images
content_image = tf.image.decode_image(tf.io.read_file('path_to_content_image.jpg'))
style_image = tf.image.decode_image(tf.io.read_file('path_to_style_image.jpg'))

# Apply style transfer
stylized_image = hub_model([content_image, style_image])[0]

# Save the resulting image
tf.keras.preprocessing.image.save_img('stylized_image.jpg', stylized_image)

8. TensorBoard

Visualizing Training with TensorBoard

TensorBoard is a powerful tool for visualizing metrics like accuracy, loss, and more during training.

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import datasets, layers, models

# Load the MNIST dataset
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = datasets.mnist.load_data()
train_images, test_images = train_images / 255.0, test_images / 255.0

# Build a simple ANN model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Setup TensorBoard callback
log_dir = "logs/fit/"
tensorboard_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir=log_dir, histogram_freq=1)

# Train the model with TensorBoard callback
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels), callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])

9. Object Detection in TensorFlow

Building an Object Detection Model

For object detection, TensorFlow provides an object detection API with pre-trained models like SSD or YOLO.

pip install tensorflow-object-detection-api

import tensorflow as tf

# Load pre-trained object detection model
model = tf.saved_model.load('ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite_320x320/saved_model')

# Load and process an image
image = tf.image.decode_image(tf.io.read_file('image.jpg'))
input_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(image)
input_tensor = input_tensor[tf.newaxis,...]

# Perform object detection
detections = model(input_tensor)
print(detections)
